                <p pazly-editable="innerHTML"  class="text-sm whitespace-pre-line">Drivers Education of America was started in 2014 on the back of our 20+ years of experience in teaching students how to drive. Our sole purpose was to educate young adults with constructive and beneficial drivers education knowledge. Being in this business, we tried out every available driver education course in the state of Texas and we saw how our knowledge of available technology could make learning faster, easier and more fun. The other course that we tried were either all reading or just primitive driving animations which didnâ€™t realistically show how to drive. We then realized what better than actual driving videos in real situations that will truly help the student benefit from our course.
